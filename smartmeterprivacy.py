# QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

""" Reviewer (Student): TODO: YOUR NAME HERE! """

# Question Q1: Describe what this smart metering privacy system tries to achieve, and 
# what techniques it is using from the course? Under what assumptions on the meters
# and authorities can an ideal system using those techniques guarantee 
# integrity and privacy? [5 Marks]

""" his smart metering privacy system aims to remotely process smart meter readings of 
user's devices in an efficient way whilst preserving the userâ€™s privacy. 
The authorities are able to have confidential access of how electricity 
is consumed and aggregates statistics without revealing any personal 
information about the users'. The system employs a secret-sharing technique 
to process the meter readings in a privacy-preserving fashion to protect 
the consumption information from being leaked. The protocol also implements 
a signature scheme to sign and encrypt the meter readings.  Privacy is 
guaranteed that if one of the authorities (e.g. G) is properly implemented 
in the protocol, the meter readings cannot disclose any personal information 
when processing authorized queries. Integrity is guaranteed under the assumption 
that the authorities comply with the protocol and, that they are honest and transparent 
in the way they operate the system. """

# of this privacy system. Describe the impact of each flaw. When a flaw is identified indicate
