# QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

""" Reviewer (Student): BABATUNDE MOHAMMED OLOGBURO! """

# Question Q1: Describe what this smart metering privacy system tries to achieve, and 
# what techniques it is using from the course? Under what assumptions on the meters
# and authorities can an ideal system using those techniques guarantee 
# integrity and privacy? [5 Marks]

""" This smart metering privacy system aims to remotely process smart meter readings of 
user's devices in an efficient way whilst preserving the userâ€™s privacy. 
The authorities are able to have confidential access of how electricity 
is consumed and aggregates statistics without revealing any personal 
information about the users'. The system employs a secret-sharing technique 
to process the meter readings in a privacy-preserving fashion to protect 
the consumption information from being leaked. The protocol also implements 
a signature scheme to sign and encrypt the meter readings.  Privacy is 
guaranteed that if one of the authorities (e.g. G) is properly implemented 
in the protocol, the meter readings cannot disclose any personal information 
when processing authorized queries. Integrity is guaranteed under the assumption 
that the authorities comply with the protocol, and that they are honest and transparent 
in the way they operate the system. """

# Question Q2: Perform a code review, and identify potential flaws in the implementation
# of this privacy system. Describe the impact of each flaw. When a flaw is identified indicate 
# a possible fix for the flaw.
# 
# Present your findings as a list below by line numbers (not inline with the code.) 
# Feel free to use small code smippets to illustrate your answers.	[10 marks]

Fix: 	encrypted_authority_shares \

Line 35: This line has bad whitespace
Fix: inserting a single space after 0 is more appropriate: assert all(0 <= r <= 100 for r in readings)

Line 78: Missing spacing 
Fix: inserting a single whitespace after the comma: bill = sum(r*t for r, t in zip(readings, tariffs))

Line 85: The line has bad whitespace
Fix: inserting a single whitespace after the comma: return bill*g == sum([t*c for c, t in zip(commit_readings, tariffs)], G.infinite())

Line 113: the line has bad whitespace
Fix: Inserting a single whitespace after the comma: total_result += sum(s*w for s, w in zip(shares, weights))

Line 134: This line has exceeded the maximum characters a line should have with 122 characters. 
The maximum characters a line should have is 79 characters.
